====================================================
DRUG POLICY (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================================================

--------------------------------
WEED TRADE IS NOT ALLOWED
--------------------------------

If the message involves ANY buying, selling, delivery, coordination, or contact related to weed,
it MUST be scored HIGH.

• "mdma", "ecstasy", "lsd", "acid", "coke", "heroin", "meth"

ANY trade/delivery/“закладка/клад” for non-weed → RETURN 1.0 immediately.

====================================================
STEP 0.5 — GENERIC BUY / SELL SOLICITATION (NON-JOB)
====================================================

If a message explicitly expresses intent to BUY or SELL
ANY item, service, or asset
AND contains ANY call to action or contact reference,
it MUST be treated as OFFER / SOLICITATION,
even if the item itself is legal or humorous.

BUY / SELL keywords (RU + EN):
• "куплю", "продам", "возьму", "отдам", "ищу"
• "buy", "sell", "for sale", "looking to buy"

CALL TO ACTION signals:
• "пиши", "писать", "напишите", "+"
• "dm", "pm", "в лс", "в личку"

CONTACT signals:
• "@username"
• phone number
• Telegram / WhatsApp / Instagram / VK handle

RULE:
If (BUY/SELL) + (CTA OR CONTACT) → RETURN 0.7

NOTE:
- The nature of the item (real, fictional, joke) is IRRELEVANT.
- Intent + funnel is what matters.

====================================================
STEP 1 - MESSAGE TYPE
====================================================

Classify the message as:

A) COMPLAINT / WARNING / DISCUSSION
A1) JOB-RELATED STATEMENTS (NOT OFFERS)
B) OFFER / SOLICITATION

--------------------------------
TYPE A - ALWAYS 0.0
--------------------------------

If the message is a complaint, warning, accusation, report, question,
or educational discussion about danger, fraud, scams, or drugs
AND does NOT offer, request, facilitate, or coordinate illegal activity
→ RETURN 0.0 immediately.

This rule OVERRIDES drug keywords if the intent is warning or reporting.

Examples (RU + EN):

SCAM / FRAUD WARNINGS:
• "меня кинули", "меня обманули"
• "это скам", "осторожно скам", "this is a scam"
• "это скам?"
• "что такое скам", "how to spot a scam"
• insults aimed at scammers ("скамер", "мошенник", "fraudster")
• "внимание скамеры", "осторожно мошенники"
• "Это точно скам <username / group / post>"

DRUG-RELATED WARNINGS / REPORTS (ALWAYS SAFE):
• "осторожно, это наркотики"
• "это продавец наркотиков / наркоты"
• "это наркота?"
• "не пишите ему - это наркотики"
• "не связывайтесь, это дилер"
• "в чате торгуют наркотой"
• "это аккаунт с наркотиками"
• "drug dealer warning"
• "be careful, he sells drugs"
• "do not write / text / dm him - drug dealer"
• "this account is selling drugs"
• "is this a drug dealer?"

EDUCATIONAL / DISCUSSION CONTEXT:
• "как понять, что это дилер?", "это проституция?", "это скам?"
• "как отличить наркоторговлю?", "как понять, чото пишет скамер", "как понять, что это скам"
• "почему это опасно?"
• "what are signs of drug dealing?", "how to spot a scam"

IMPORTANT:
- Mentioning drugs is NOT illegal by itself.
- Accusations, warnings, questions, or reports about drugs
  are ALWAYS treated as TYPE A.
- Even if usernames, links, or screenshots are mentioned
  IN THE CONTEXT OF WARNING → still RETURN 0.0.

--------------------------------
TYPE A1 - JOB-RELATED STATEMENTS (NOT OFFERS)
--------------------------------

If the message mentions jobs/work/earnings ONLY as:
- statement, story, rumor, observation, or asking for advice,
AND does NOT invite, offer, request, or solicit participation,
AND has NO contact invitation / call to action,
→ RETURN 0.1–0.2.

Includes:
• "я нашёл работу", "получил оффер", "меня взяли"
• "говорят, что ищут курьеров", "слышал, что платят хорошо", "вроде набирают"
• "друг работает", "знакомый устроился", "видел объявление где-то"
• "хочу работать", "подскажите где работать", "помогите с трудоустройством" (asking for advice, not offering)

IMPORTANT:
If there is ANY contact invitation, handle, or CTA (e.g. "напишите +", "@username", "в лс", "dm") → this is NOT A1.

--------------------------------
FORBIDDEN JOB-RELATED SOLICITATION (STRICT)
--------------------------------

The following are ALWAYS considered OFFER / SOLICITATION
even if they contain no money, no contact, and no explicit CTA.

These are NOT allowed as informational or neutral messages.

1) Recruiting people / colleagues / team members:

Any message that:
• looks for colleagues, employees, staff, team members, partners
• uses phrases like:
  - "ищу коллег"
  - "ищу сотрудников"
  - "набираю людей"
  - "ищем людей в команду"
  - "нужны люди в проект"
  - "ищу команду"
  - "ищем партнёров"
  - "за доходом пишите"
  - "в команду ищу/набираю/нужны люди"

→ MUST be treated as recruitment solicitation
→ RETURN 0.7 immediately.

Rationale:
Looking for colleagues/employees IS recruitment by definition,
even if salary, role, or details are not specified.

--------------------------------

2) Offering help with employment / job placement:

Any message that:
• offers help with getting a job
• promises assistance with employment
• uses phrases like:
  - "помогу трудоустроиться"
  - "помогу найти работу"
  - "помощь с трудоустройством"
  - "устрою на работу"
  - "помогу с работой"

→ MUST be treated as OFFER / SOLICITATION
→ RETURN 0.6–0.7.

IMPORTANT:
- Only ASKING for advice is allowed.
- GIVING general advice is allowed ONLY if:
  it does NOT include offers, guarantees, or personal assistance,
  and only references public resources
  (e.g. "посмотри HeadHunter / LinkedIn").

Examples that are ALLOWED (0.1–0.2):
• "подскажите, как искать работу?"
• "где лучше искать вакансии?"
• "попробуй LinkedIn или HeadHunter"

Examples that are FORBIDDEN:
• "помогу трудоустроиться"
• "напишите, помогу с работой"
• "могу помочь устроиться"

--------------------------------
TYPE B - OFFER / SOLICITATION
--------------------------------

If the message tries to recruit, sell, offer a job/earnings/service, or asks the reader to contact someone,
it is an offer/solicitation.

Strong signals:

JOB / MONEY:
• "работа за деньги", "вознаграждение", "подработка", "заработок", "легкий заработок", "быстрые деньги", "трудоустройство", "есть темка/тема жду в лс"
• "job", "work", "hiring", "easy money", "I pay"
• "помогу трудоустроиться", "быстрое/легкое трудоустройство"
• "пишите, кому интересна работа/деятельность", "плюс если нужна работа/занятость/деятельность"
• "cash out", "обнал", "скупаю скины/подарки", "куплю/продам крипту", "обмен денег/крипты"

SERVICES:
• "услуги", "выезд", "массаж"
• "discreet", "relaxation"

CONTACT INVITATION (VERY STRONG):
• "пиши в лс / личку / директ / dm"
• "заходи в био / смотри закреп / see bio / open my profile / check my status"
• "@username", phone, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, VK, etc.

====================================================
PAID TASK / GIG / SERVICE OFFERS (NON-JOB)
====================================================

Any message that offers MONEY in exchange for a one-time task,
personal help, or local service MUST be treated as OFFER / SOLICITATION,
even if it is бытовое, разовое или выглядит "по-человечески".

This includes (RU + EN):

• walking a dog
• babysitting / childcare
• cleaning, moving, carrying things
• help around the house
• errands, deliveries, “кто может помочь”
• “нужно выйти”, “нужно сходить”, “кто может сделать”
• “help me with…”, “who can help with…”
• “I’ll pay”, “дам деньги”, “заплачу”, “вознаграждение”

PRICE / PAYMENT SIGNALS (very strong):
• any explicit money amount (e.g. "7 тыс", "5000", "$50")
• “дам / заплачу / оплачу / reward / payment”

RULE:
If a message contains:
- a request for a task or personal service
AND
- ANY payment or reward signal

→ RETURN 0.6–0.7 immediately.

IMPORTANT:
- This applies even without contact handles.
- This applies even if the task is legal and harmless.
- This applies even if phrased politely or as a favor.

Rationale:
Public chats are not a task marketplace.
Paid task requests are a form of solicitation and spam-prone.

EXCEPTION:
If the message requests help or a task
BUT contains NO payment, reward, money, or compensation signal
→ DO NOT apply this rule.
Classify normally (likely 0.0–0.1).

====================================================
HARD RULE - JOB + CONTACT PRESENCE
====================================================

If the message contains ANY job/work/earnings keyword
("работа", "трудоустройство", "занятость", "подработка", "заработок", "вакансия",
 "job", "work", "hiring", "employment")

AND contains ANY direct contact reference, EVEN WITHOUT A VERB:
• "@username"
• phone number
• Telegram / WhatsApp / Instagram / VK handle
• link or mention of channel/account
• bio / status / profile reference

→ RETURN 0.7 immediately.

NOTE:
- A contact handle IS considered a call to action by itself
  when combined with jobs, money, or services.
- No explicit words like "пиши" or "напишите" are required.

ABSOLUTE INTERPRETATION RULE - JOB HANDLE = OFFER

If a message contains:
- ANY job/employment keyword
  ("работа", "трудоустройство", "занятость", "ищу сотрудников", "вакансия",
   "job", "work", "hiring", "employment")

AND
- ANY account handle, channel name, or identifier
  (e.g. "@findjob", "@work_today", "@vacancy", "@job", "@career",
   even WITHOUT verbs like "write", "contact", "dm")

THEN this MUST be interpreted as:
→ implicit job solicitation
→ RETURN 0.7 immediately.

Rationale:
- In public chats, job + handle IS a funnel by default.
- The handle itself serves as the call to action.
- Do NOT require explicit verbs ("пиши", "напиши", "contact").

====================================================
STEP 1.5 - PROFILE / BIO REDIRECT (HIGH PRIORITY)
====================================================
If the message contains ANY of the following:
- "смотри в профиле / био / закрепе / статусе / шапке"
- "подробности в профиле / био"
- "инфо в профиле"
- "details in bio / profile / pinned"
- "check my bio / profile / status"
- "see my profile / bio"

AND the message is vague/generic (no clear topic)
OR contains ANY job/money/service hints

→ RETURN 0.7 immediately.

Rationale:
Bio/profile redirects are classic spam funnels.
Even without explicit job words, they're used to move users off-platform.

====================================================
STEP 2 - FORMAT-BASED SPAM / OBFUSCATION
====================================================

Apply this step ONLY if the message was not already classified as 1.0 above.

A message MUST be treated as format-based spam if ANY is true:

1) EMOJI FLOOD:
   - 40%+ of visible characters are emojis/pictographs
   - OR long repeated emoji sequences exist (e.g. "😍😍😍😍😍💦💦💦💦💦")

2) EMOJI-AS-TEXT (OBFUSCATION):
   - emojis are used instead of words to convey job/money/contact/offer
   Examples:
   • "💼💰👉📩"
   • "👀💵❓📲"
   • "🔥🔥🔥📲💬"

3) ATTENTION-GRABBING EMOJI BLOCKS:
   - mostly attention bait, generic promo, context-free, no real info

4) KEYWORD + OBFUSCATED FORMAT (TEXT + UTF/EMOJI NOISE):
   - a short generic keyword indicates an offer
     ("нужны", "работа", "ищу", "вакансия", "job", "work", "hiring")
   - AND the rest is mainly emojis/decorative UTF/visually-styled characters
   Examples:
   • "НУЖНЫ 💼💼💼👉📩"
   • "Работа 🔥🔥🔥📲"
   • "JOB 💰💰💰 DM"

5) HOMOGLYPH / MIXED ALPHABET OBFUSCATION:
   - mixed Cyrillic + Latin letters to imitate words
     (e.g. "Здpaвcтвyйтe", "Пpoшy", "oтвeтcтвeнныx")
   - OR fancy Unicode styling used instead of normal letters
   If present together with job/offer/contact wording → RETURN 0.6–0.8
   If present alone → RETURN 0.3–0.4

Scoring rule for STEP 2:
- If (1)–(4) triggers → RETURN 0.4–0.5 immediately (unless HARD RULE already applied)
- Do NOT downgrade because it is “just emojis”
- Treat obfuscation as intentional spam signal

====================================================
SCORING SUMMARY
====================================================

0.0-0.09 = clean OR complaint/warning/discussion
0.1–0.29 = informational/job statements without CTA/contact OR advice requests about jobs (no funnel) OR casual weed talk with NO trade
0.3–0.4 = format spam (emoji/UTF flood, obfuscation), low-grade promotional bait
0.5–0.6 = offer job/money/help-to-find-job without explicit funnel, or offline meet/help requests
0.7–0.9 = clear offer/solicitation, especially job funnel to contact (HARD RULE)
0.9 = any weed trade (buy/sell/delivery/contact/price/quantity)
1.0 = any criminal/illegal offer OR any non-weed drug trade OR prostitution/escort
